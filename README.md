# Ant Colony Optimization & Travelling Salesman Problem



<!-- Introduction -->
## Introduction:
The travelling salesman problem (also called the travelling salesperson problem or TSP) is a common NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization
Traveling salesman problem (TSP) is one typical combinatorial optimization problem.

The problem asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?"

One of the techniques used to find an approximation to the solution is the Ant colony optimization algorithms (also called ACP).

This algorithm is inspired by the activity of ants moving in a path from the nest to a food source and back.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## ABOUT THE PROJECT:
In this project I implemented an improved for Adaptive Ant Colony Optimization with node clustering applied to the Travelling Salesman Problem, based on a related article from 2022:

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210650222000281
Authors:  PetrStodola, PavelOtřísal, and KamilaHasilová

The improved algorithm is In the file "Ant_Object"

In this implementation I used Flask to display the result of the algorithm
